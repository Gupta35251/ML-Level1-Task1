Task 1: Data Preprocessing for Machine Learning
Description

This project focuses on preprocessing a raw dataset to make it suitable for machine learning tasks. Data preprocessing is a crucial step that ensures the quality and usability of data, improving the performance and reliability of machine learning models.
Objectives

    Handle missing data:
    Detect and address missing values in the dataset. This can involve filling missing values using statistical methods (such as mean or median) or removing rows/columns with too many missing values.

    Encode categorical variables:
    Convert categorical (non-numeric) data into numerical format so that machine learning algorithms can process them. Common techniques include one-hot encoding (creating binary columns for each category) and label encoding (assigning each category a unique integer).

    Normalize or standardize numerical features:
    Adjust the scale of numeric features to ensure they contribute equally to the model. Normalization scales values to a range (usually 0 to 1), while standardization transforms values to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

    Split the dataset into training and testing sets:
    Divide the data into two subsets: one for training the model and one for evaluating its performance. This helps prevent overfitting and provides a realistic assessment of how the model will perform on unseen data.

    Tools:

        Python: The main programming language used.

        pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

        scikit-learn: For preprocessing functions and splitting data.
